# Tweet-bote
twitter bot that posts random quotes separated by full stops.
## Introduction

This code is for a python bot connected to heroku to run every hour and every two hours and post to twitter. The first bot - post.py posts every two hours a quote from the text file speech.txt. The second bot - tests.py posts every hour a markov generated quote

## Dependencies

* [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org) - Twitter API for python
* [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) - Markov string generator
There is a [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file included for use with pip installer.


## Deployment

I use heroku for deployment but for small builds it can be run on anything in the background.
